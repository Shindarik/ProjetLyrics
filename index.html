        <p>On a dark desert highway<br>
            Cool wind in my hair<br>
            Warm smell of colitas<br>
            Rising up through the air<br>
            Up ahead in the distance<br>
            I saw a shimmering light<br>
            My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
            I had to stop for the night<br>
            There she stood in the doorway<br>
            I heard the mission bell<br>
            And I was thinking to myself<br>
            "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br>
            Then she lit up a candle<br>
            And she showed me the way<br>
            There were voices down the corridor<br>
            I thought I heard them say<br><br><br>
            "Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
            Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
            Such a lovely face<br>
            Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
            Any time of year (Any time of year)<br>
            You can find it here"<br><br><br>
            Her mind is Tiffany-twisted<br>
            She got the Mercedes Benz, uh<br>
            She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys<br>
            That she calls friends<br>
            How they dance in the courtyard<br>
            Sweet summer sweat<br>
            Some dance to remember<br>
            Some dance to forget<br>
            So I called up the Captain<br>
            "Please bring me my wine"<br>
            He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"<br>
            And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
            Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
            Just to hear them say<br><br><br>
            "Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
            Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
            Such a lovely face<br>
            They living it up at the Hotel California<br>
            What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)<br>
            Bring your alibis"<br><br><br>
            Mirrors on the ceiling<br>
            The pink champagne on ice<br>
            And she said: "We are all just prisoners here<br>
            Of our own device"<br>
            And in the master's chambers<br>
            They gathered for the feast<br>
            They stab it with their steely knives<br>
            But they just can't kill the beast<br>
            Last thing I remember, I was<br>
            Running for the door<br>
            I had to find the passage back<br>
            To the place I was before<br>
            "Relax," said the night man<br>
            "We are programmed to receive<br>
            You can check out any time you like<br>
            But you can never leave!"</p>
